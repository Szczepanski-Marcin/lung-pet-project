PET Image Analysis Pipeline (Lung Cancer Dataset)

📌 Overview

Medical imaging plays a critical role in modern oncology, particularly in assessing tumor metabolism and treatment response. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans provide rich functional information, but transforming raw imaging data into actionable insights requires a structured and reproducible workflow.

In this project, I developed an end-to-end PET image analysis pipeline using a public lung cancer dataset. The goal was to simulate a realistic clinical and research environment, where imaging data is processed, validated, and analyzed to extract meaningful quantitative biomarkers.

Starting from raw DICOM images, the pipeline performs preprocessing, quality control, segmentation of high-uptake regions, and quantitative analysis of tumor characteristics. The final outputs include both visualizations and structured data that could support downstream tasks such as statistical analysis or machine learning.

This project is designed to reflect workflows commonly used in oncology research and clinical trials, providing a practical demonstration of how medical imaging data can be translated into measurable insights.
