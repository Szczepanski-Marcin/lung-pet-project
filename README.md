🧠 PET Image Classification for Lung Cancer Subtypes
📌 Project Overview

This project explores lung cancer subtype classification using PET scan data. The goal is to extract meaningful radiomics-inspired features from medical images and train a machine learning model to distinguish between cancer types.

The pipeline demonstrates:

Medical image preprocessing (DICOM handling)
Feature extraction (intensity, texture, shape proxies)
Machine learning classification
Model evaluation using clinically relevant metrics

Dataset
Source: Lung Cancer PET/CT dataset (DICOM format)
Classes:
Adenocarcinoma
Squamous Cell Carcinoma
Small Cell Carcinoma
Large Cell Carcinoma
Total samples: ~18,500 slices

Important limitation
The dataset does not provide tumor segmentation masks or patient IDs.
Therefore:
Feature extraction is performed on full images and proxy regions
True tumor localization is not possible
Potential data leakage may exist due to slice-level splitting

⚙️ Methodology
1. Data Loading & Preprocessing
DICOM images loaded using pydicom
Pixel intensities normalized to [0, 1]
Empty or invalid images removed

2. Feature Extraction
To represent each scan numerically, three groups of features were extracted:
🟦 Intensity Features
Mean intensity
Standard deviation
Maximum intensity
10th and 90th percentiles
🟩 Texture Features (GLCM)
Contrast
Homogeneity
Energy

These capture spatial intensity patterns in the image.

🟨 Shape Proxy
Approximate “high-intensity region volume” using percentile thresholding

⚠️ This is a proxy feature, not true tumor segmentation.

🔹 3. Model Training
Model: Random Forest Classifier
Parameters:
n_estimators=200
class_weight="balanced"
Validation:
80/20 train-test split
5-fold stratified cross-validation

🧠 Key Insights
The model achieves ~81% accuracy, showing that basic radiomics features contain predictive signal.
Performance varies significantly across classes:
Strong performance on Adenocarcinoma
Weak performance on Large Cell Carcinoma (likely due to class imbalance)
Texture and intensity features contribute most to model decisions.

⚠️ Limitations
This project intentionally highlights real-world challenges in medical imaging:
❌ No tumor segmentation masks → no true ROI-based features
❌ Slice-level splitting → potential data leakage
❌ Class imbalance affects minority class performance
❌ PET intensity not standardized (no SUV normalization)


🚀 Future Improvements
Use patient-level splitting to avoid leakage
Incorporate true tumor segmentation masks
Apply deep learning (CNNs / 3D models)
Use PyRadiomics for standardized feature extraction
Combine PET with CT (multimodal learning)

💼 Relevance for Medical Imaging Roles
This project demonstrates:
Understanding of medical imaging pipelines
Experience with DICOM data handling
Ability to extract and interpret radiomics features
Proper use of ML evaluation metrics
Awareness of clinical and methodological limitations
